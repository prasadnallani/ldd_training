This Readme file explains about the application that we are going to create and how to use makefiles for creation of the application.

Application Description:	
	We need to create an application for saving and viewing   of the Image formats.This
	application consists of the menu using which we can save and also view Images.

	In this example ( Application ) we used two layers

	1) UI -- takes care of handling user interface.

	2) IML -- image manuplation layer ( takes care of different image types).

	our application is designed to handle only one type of files.

	When we want to build this application to take care of new images
	we need to replace IML which takes care of new images.
	
	Note:
		In this we are using the pseudo(dummy) code in this application
		and in the real implementation of the application we need to write
		the actual code.
